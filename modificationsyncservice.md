## ModificationSyncService

The `ModificationSyncService` is a REST service that can be used to synchronize the access to shared resources from multiple applications. Such resources may be a central database or interfaces to external systems, for example. Applications can request a lock to a certain resource and if the resource is not locked already the request will be granted and recorded. Otherwise the application will be notified that a lock exists so that it can react accordingly, e.g. by notifying the user or postpone the processing of the resource. The business framework of SDACK can use a sync service to synchronize requests to persistent entities in a database.

The service is part of the esoco-lib library of SDACK. It is implemented in Java as a server application that listens for HTTP requests on a certain port \(default 7962 = SYNC\). This makes it simple to run it as a Microservice, e.g. in a Docker container. To connect to a sync service from an application esoco-lib also contains the `ModificationSyncEndpoint` that provides a simple `Endpoint` interface to sync services. For the administration of running sync services the command line tool `ModificationSyncServiceTool` can be used.

The sync service can be accessed through several URLs relative to the service address. Requests to these URLs must be in JSON format which is also used for the responses. The main URL is `/api/sync/` under which the actual synchronization API is available to applications. There are also some additional URLs that can be accessed:

* `/info`: displays some basic informations about the service \(this is also the default if the service address is invoked without a URL
* `/ping` and `/healthcheck`: both return true if the service is up and running. Can be used for monitoring purposes
* `/api/status` provides serveral endpoints to query the service status:
  * `/api/status/uptime`: the uptime of the service in milliseconds
  * `/api/status/start_date`: the start date and time of the service in the standard ISO date-time format
  * `/api/status/current_locks`: the currently held locks, mirrored from the sync API
* `/api/control` allows to query **and modify** the service:
  * `/api/control/run` always returns true; settings this to false will terminate the service immediately
  * `/api/control/log_level` returns the log level of the service; it can set set to either `TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR,` or `FATAL` to set the logging level of the service

The main sync service API under `/api/sync` provides the following endpoints:

* `/api/sync/check_lock`: check whether a certain lock already exists
* `/api/sync/request_lock`: register a new lock for the current client if it not already exists
* `/api/sync/release_lock`: release a lock held by the current client
* `/api/sync/current_locks`: list the locks currently held by the service \(mirrored as `/api/status/current_locks`\)

In addition, the API is mirrored under the base URL `/webapi` which provides a simple HTML view of the service API. This provides a way to quickly check the service status from a web browser. Service modifications are not possible through the web service. For that purpose the [ModificationSyncServiceTool](#modificationsyncservicetool) \(or the regular API\) should be used.
